"Advent of Cubes"
=================

Solving foam cubes in haskell.

https://www.tspurling.co.uk/foam-cubes/  (probably but not certainly the latest version)

Passed a long flight\* and then some!

- Solver;

- Command line printouts of solutions;

- Slightly broken OpenGL 3D rendering of solutions;

- three.js rendering of solutions from Haskell via Haste.

Very not tidy and/or finished but uploading it now so that I don't have to wonder when I'll upload it.
